Your Queue class is up and working in a customer service company. The company opens up a new branch and asks you to make another version of the Queue for them. The only difference is the way the Queue is displayed: each number on a new line.

// You decide to create a new class called Queue2, which is derived from the Queue class and overrides the print() method, outputting each element of the queue on a new line.
